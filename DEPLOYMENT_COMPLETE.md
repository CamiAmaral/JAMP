# 🎉 JAMP Website Deployment - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done

Your JAMP website has been successfully prepared for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's everything that was completed:

### 1. Website Structure Created
- ✅ Created `docs/` folder as the deployment source
- ✅ Copied all website files from `jamp/jamp-website/`:
  - `index.html` (main page)
  - `css/styles.css` (all styles)
  - `js/main.js` (JavaScript functionality)
  - `img/` directory (all images: logo.png, 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg)

### 2. File Paths Fixed
- ✅ Updated all paths in `index.html` to work from the docs root
- ✅ Changed `../css/` → `css/`
- ✅ Changed `../js/` → `js/`
- ✅ Changed `../img/` → `img/`
- ✅ Fixed favicon to use `logo.png` (the available file)

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Created
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- ✅ Configured automatic deployment on push to main or this branch
- ✅ Set up proper permissions for GitHub Pages

### 4. Testing
- ✅ Tested website locally - all files load correctly
- ✅ Verified CSS, JavaScript, and images are accessible
- ✅ Code review passed with no issues
- ✅ Security scan (CodeQL) - no vulnerabilities found

## 🚀 NEXT STEP: Enable GitHub Pages (Required!)

To complete the deployment, you need to enable GitHub Pages:

### How to Enable:

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/CamiAmaral/JAMP

2. **Click "Settings"** (top right, near About section)

3. **In the left sidebar, click "Pages"**

4. **Under "Build and deployment"**:
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   
5. **Save** (if prompted)

6. **Wait a few moments** - the workflow will automatically run

### Your Website Will Be At:
```
https://camiamaral.github.io/JAMP/
```

## 📝 How It Works

- Every time you push to the `main` branch (or this PR branch), the website will automatically redeploy
- The workflow deploys everything from the `docs/` folder
- You can also manually trigger deployment from the Actions tab

## 🔄 How to Update the Website

### Option 1: Edit Source Files
1. Make changes in `jamp/jamp-website/` directory
2. Copy updated files to `docs/` (and adjust paths if needed)
3. Commit and push

### Option 2: Direct Updates
1. Edit files directly in `docs/` folder
2. Commit and push
3. Changes will automatically deploy

## ⚠️ Current Status

- ✅ All files prepared and committed
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is ready
- ⏳ **Waiting for you to enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
- 🔜 Once enabled, site will deploy automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow shows "action_required"?
This is normal! It means GitHub Pages needs to be enabled. Follow the steps above.

### Site not deploying?
1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings > Pages)
2. Make sure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check the Actions tab for workflow status
4. Ensure repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

### Files not loading?
All paths have been tested and verified. If you see 404 errors after deployment:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify files exist in the `docs/` folder
3. Clear browser cache and try again

## 📧 Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the repository's Actions tab for deployment logs
- Verify all steps in SETUP_GITHUB_PAGES.md were followed
- Ensure the repository is public

## 🎊 You're Almost There!

Just enable GitHub Pages in settings, and your professional website will be live on the internet! 🚀
